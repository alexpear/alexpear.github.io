some notes for eco waffle

idea for fantasy entity actions
- entities have an age counter, and eg humans dont gain access to the
  Become (Settlement) action until they reach a specified age
- so advanced actions require both a weight and a min age in the template?
  - that could be later down the MRB path.
- Entities could move off the map and go into the offMap area.
  - They have a random chance to come back, on a random spot on one of the edges.
