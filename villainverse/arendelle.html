<p>In the north, King Hans has defied Rome & sided with the claimant Pope Severinus II of Paris. Called the Dawn King, he bears a flaming sceptre that is said to miraculously turn his enemies to stone. "Lies," mutters an iron-shackled woman in the silent dungeons. In the town square, her stone likeness cowers, a statue built to trick the people into believing.</p>
<p>To the west lies <a href="britain.html" class="wikilink">Britain</a>. Ice statues gleam as London readies for the royal wedding. King Hans has offered the hand of Princess Anna to King John the Lion. Everyone is delighted by the arrangment, except the bride, who mutters behind her veil, "Love is a one-way door".</p>
<p>To the south lies <a href="germany.html" class="wikilink">Germany</a>. "I don't know how you got in here," says the women beneath Arendelle Castle, "but I want nothing of your sorcery. Vade retro me satana!" But the hook-nosed witch smiles patiently.</p>
<p>To the southeast lies <a href="corona.html" class="wikilink">Corona</a>. The trolls fear Corona, & will not sail upon its waters. They believe its clear sunlight will turn them to stone.</p>
