      <label>The Jungle</label>
<p>An ancient Shaivite temple looms over a field of blackened stumps. It has been taken over by the impious Bonfire King, a mighty orangutan whose arms stretch longer than anacondas. Guarded night & day by wary gibbons, the Dynastic Fire flickers in the courtyard, fed hourly on jungle lumber. This wood, & fruit, & martial service are the tribute paid by jungle creatures to the Bonfire King. Peacocks gift him fine earthworms, & even ants carry kindling to his throne. Those defiant species, like the peaceable Bears, have woken to a red glow at midnight, & fled as their homes transformed to Hellfire, then ashes. But guilt glowers too, in the heart of torchbearing Abu on the steps of the temple.</p>
<p>To the northwest lies <a href="agrabah.html" class="wikilink">Agrabah</a>. On his morning walk through the Garden, Jafar caresses a mighty jungle vine curiously. Then he asks: "Interloper, name thyself!" The vine unloops: a great python. "The name's Kaa, of the Jungle of the Bonfire King." Jafar unloops also, rising tree-tall in form of serpent. "You hide from a friend, legless one," says Jafar. "I too am of fire." Kaa replies, with hungry eyes: "I know, the smokeless fire at your fingertips. But I wonder if your mind is of similar strength, or if that is your weakness..." And Jafar gazes back, & wonders also.</p>
<p>To the northeast lies <a href="china.html" class="wikilink">China</a>. Surprised by the agility & aggression of the Bonfire King's apes, the Hun armies have retreated to the Great Wall, defending it from the Chinese side. Horse archers skirmish against elephant-riding monkeys, while macaques throw stolen gunpowder bombs.</p>
<p>To the east lies <a href="kumandra.html" class="wikilink">Kumandra</a>. Statues of firebearing apes decorate the borderlands. Yet the sneakiest monkeys managed to evade the billowing Druun. They lurk in the Kumandran treetops, waiting for a moment of carelessness in which to steal a shiny object.</p>
