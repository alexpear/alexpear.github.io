      <label>Zootopia</label>
<p>There is a land unknown to Human where the claw is subject to the hoof. The lions march shackled before the mocking-tongued goats. Civility & cruelty hold hands in Zootopia, where unfree Pluto's jeweled collar reads "Property of Scrooge McDuck". Those who show mercy are exiled to the countryside ... but may perhaps befriend an outlaw trio there, duck dog & mouse, who live as casteless equals.</p>
<p><a href="bambi.html" class="wikilink">The Deer Forest</a>: Walking the deer paths that connect the worlds, Great Prince of the Forest Bambi emerges from Savannah Central Park in Zootopia with his antlers held high. He is here to give a speech on the harmony between prey & predators.</p>
<p><a href="pridelands.html" class="wikilink">The Pride Lands</a>: The young lions of the Pride are trained by scouting for rabbit-holes that lead to Zootopia. Well-armed bunnies & rats make sprinting raids on predator territory, trying to free prisoners & effect regime change.</p>
<p><a href="agrabah.html" class="wikilink">Agrabah</a>: Every full moon in Zootopia's Sahara Square, the winged Simurgh carries armed emissaries from Agrabah. Bridled hyenas she bears, with hares in the saddles. These intruders are resisted immediately by Zootopia's Herbivore Corps. Tortoise veterans strike at the hyenas with spears. Gorilla charioteers toss nets to capture the away-darting fallen hares.</p>
