      <label>The Incan Empire</label>
<p>A shadow has fallen on the Andes. Empress Yzma sits the throne, usurper of the foolish yet rightful Cuzco. Years of studying Atlantean relics have made her a master of the alchemical arts. Now she uses this knowledge against all who disagree with her. The forest is filling with her enemies, transformed into strange animals, incompetent in their new bodies.</p>
<p>To the north lies <a href="colombia.html" class="wikilink">Encanto</a>. One night, twelve Incan soldiers leapt through the windows of Casa Madrigal, bottled the breath of everyone sleeping in the house, & flew away, carried by a giant purple hawk. A sorceress of the Andes brewed these pneumatic essences into thousands of crystal phials, laughing as she did so. Now her empire threatens Encanto's perimeter with its own abilities. Her armies clear the rain when attacking, & gather storms when defending. Sword-slashed soldiers jeer & pull out Chef Kronk's magical arepas, healing them instantly. Even the beasts of the jungle have been recruited: strong jaguar, swift toucan, tricky squirrel.</p>
<p>To the west lies <a href="motunui.html" class="wikilink">Motunui</a>. One shipborne polity has fled Te KƒÅ all the way to the Incan coast, bearing with them the defeated yet cheerful demigod Maui. Claiming a forgotten harbor as their new home, they were immediately engaged by the forces of the irate Empress. But while the Empire has mastered the mountains, none can match Maui at sea. Dispatching the sorceress' octopus-form soldiers, he opines, "What could be better than a world full of foes?"</p>
