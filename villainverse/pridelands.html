      <label>The Pride Lands</label>
<p>On the savannah, mice live like kings, each burrow a palace. The grass is empty of all creatures too slow to escape the lion's claw. Gazelle, wild dog, elephant, all are gathered in shivering herds, perimetered night & day by jailor lions. For cruel generations, the pride has not ruled but farmed for meat.</p>
<p>To the north lies <a href="agrabah.html" class="wikilink">Agrabah</a>. Some nights, the lions sing pride-songs of their preparations for conquest. One night, they were midsong silenced & their mouths shut, for in the central bonfire there had flickered up from nowhere a human. "Lo!", she said, "I am Nasira, emissary of Almighty Jafar. I know that you have dreamed of four kingdoms. A reign of lions. A reign of demons. A reign of lesser cats. And a reign of iron. You dream the truth! The world will bristle with the armies of conquerors, & the fourth conqueror will be the great Jafar." And throughout the den the lions' mouths were shut.</p>
<p>To the south lies <a href="claytonville.html" class="wikilink">Claytonville</a>. Cruel traps perimeter the woods around Claytonville. Any beast netted is sold by weight to the farms of the meat-hungry Pride.</p>
<p><a href="britain.html" class="wikilink">Britain</a>: English ships bearing gold & dried meat support the Pride regime, for King John is in fact a descendant of the Scar dynasty.</p>
<p><a href="zootopia.html" class="wikilink">Zootopia</a>: The young lions of the Pride are trained by scouting for rabbit-holes that lead to Zootopia. Well-armed bunnies & rats make sprinting raids on predator territory, trying to free prisoners & effect regime change.</p>
