      <label>Atlantis</label>
<p>For millennia, Atlantis slept, fearful of its own strength. Then, an expedition from the newly-independent USA executed a daring coup & began ruling Atlantis as a puppet state. A colony of a colony, American Atlantis is somewhere between a state & a hostage situation.</p>
<p>To the east lies <a href="ursula.html" class="wikilink">the Mermaid Kingdom</a>. As giant squid grapple the sensors of the Atlantean Leviathan, a delegation of sharks rushes past, surging into the waterways of the lost city. They carry shipwreck gold & paperwork. Ursula wishes to make a generous donation to the Smithsonian Institution, & become a minority shareholder in the Ulysses expedition. For Ursula's endgame is to be queen of Atlantis & the one profession the Americans forgot to bring is lawyer.</p>
<p>To the west lies <a href="virginia.html" class="wikilink">the United States</a>. The new administration of Atlantis is learning to exploit the lost city' arts. Glowing stone aircraft now float in clumsy circles round Washington's skies. Machine guns have been bolted to their sides, but when the Americans learn to activate their crystal weapons, history may repeat itself.</p>
<p><a href="motunui.html" class="wikilink">Motunui</a>: Although the life-giving Titan Te Fiti never harbored any intention of war, the ancient Atlanteans watched her with fearful mistrust. The mere existence of beings like her motivated the development of their incredible forcefields & weaponry.</p>
<p><a href="space.html" class="wikilink">Outer Space</a>: Atlantis has long known the secrets of riding a pillar of alchemical fire up into the heavens. Now, American expeditions ride Atlantean spacecraft they barely understand into deep space. Speeding boldly towards planets rumored to contain lost technology, they pray to evade the telescopes of Captain Flint's pirates.</p>
<p><a href="strangeworld.html" class="wikilink">The Strange World</a>: The Illumineers of ancient Atlantis were familiar with the strange world of Avalonia - perhaps even with every world.</p>
