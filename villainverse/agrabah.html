      <label>Agrabah</label>
<p>The Agrabah rainforest was once a desert city. Instead of streets, it now has rivers. Instead of slums, sequoias. Mongoose & tiger pick fruit together, fangs forgotten, unaging. Beneath the forest floor sprawls an underground palace nineteen stories deep, containing Atlantean texts, jarred Proteans, pixie dust. Above the redwoods soars the skyscraper Latter Babel, seat of Jafar the Unfettered. In his veins glimmer fire, stolen from the djinn. It is no longer sorcery that he envies; it is God. Wielding the same power that produced Creation in six days, he has remade Eden in Agrabah. Now his gaze flickers across the future, plotting a Day of Judgement wherein Earth judges Heaven.</p>
<p>To the northwest lies <a href="greece.html" class="wikilink">Mount Olympos</a>. The Agrabah Sultinate is the only power in the Mediterranean that can match the might of Mount Olympos. Serpents of fire patrol Jerusalem's walls, as the jealous Cyclops wades out of the sea to make war.</p>
<p>To the east lies <a href="china.html" class="wikilink">China</a>. Asura Jafar, as he is known to the Khan, forgets the Earth, & his green Garden walls stand lightly guarded. But when the sagittary cavalry breach the East Gate, marvels assail them ex nihilo. King David, young, resists, ringed by slingslain corpses. Fishhooked Leviathan churns the Palace moat. Bow-armed Lazarus is shot down twelve times, but plucks & refires arrows from his own corpse.</p>
<p>To the west lies <a href="ursula.html" class="wikilink">the Mermaid Kingdom</a>. At the feet of Agrabah's walls huddle throngs of pilgrims from every land. And here shelter too two lovers, who arrived in a battered regal stagecoach full of knickknacks & fish. Suddenly, they are assailed by two enchanted sharks, their tails replaced with powerful legs! Fleeing these attackers, the redheaded lover trips & stumbles. As the sharks leap at her, she twists & draws two finecrafted blades from the scabbards on her back. In a crash of knees & fins, she slashes the hunters dead, for her arms are her most skillful limbs.</p>
<p>To the south lies <a href="pridelands.html" class="wikilink">the Pride Lands</a>. Some nights, the lions sing pride-songs of their preparations for conquest. One night, they were midsong silenced & their mouths shut, for in the central bonfire there had flickered up from nowhere a human. "Lo!", she said, "I am Nasira, emissary of Almighty Jafar. I know that you have dreamed of four kingdoms. A reign of lions. A reign of demons. A reign of lesser cats. And a reign of iron. You dream the truth! The world will bristle with the armies of conquerors, & the fourth conqueror will be the great Jafar." And throughout the den the lions' mouths were shut.</p>
<p>To the southeast lies <a href="junglebook.html" class="wikilink">the Jungle</a>. On his morning walk through the Garden, Jafar caresses a mighty jungle vine curiously. Then he asks: "Interloper, name thyself!" The vine unloops: a great python. "The name's Kaa, of the Jungle of the Bonfire King." Jafar unloops also, rising tree-tall in form of serpent. "You hide from a friend, legless one," says Jafar. "I too am of fire." Kaa replies, with hungry eyes: "I know, the smokeless fire at your fingertips. But I wonder if your mind is of similar strength, or if that is your weakness..." And Jafar gazes back, & wonders also.</p>
<p><a href="zootopia.html" class="wikilink">Zootopia</a>: Every full moon in Zootopia's Sahara Square, the winged Simurgh carries armed emissaries from Agrabah. Bridled hyenas she bears, with hares in the saddles. These intruders are resisted immediately by Zootopia's Herbivore Corps. Tortoise veterans strike at the hyenas with spears. Gorilla charioteers toss nets to capture the away-darting fallen hares.</p>
