      <label>Never Never Land</label>
<p>When infants Romulus & Remus were left to die among seven wild hills, they were found at night by a she-wolf. She carried them through a secret tunnel to an island of fairies & mermaids, where they lived in a willow-tree. Ever since, this tree (or trees or houses of similarly low quality) has been home to those children who find themselves outdoors at night with nowhere to go. But all beings under God are capable of sin, & there came a time when some of these lost ones marauded in a ship under a cruel Captain. And in time it happened that these pirates cut down the willow-tree (or tree-house, or driftwood-house) & claimed the next lost child directly as their cabin boy. "It is we who run this island," they said to him, "so get your head out of the clouds & work!"</p>
<p><a href="britain.html" class="wikilink">Britain</a>: The fairies of Neverland were born in London, but fled its iron fences, iron mills, iron doorknobs. Fey armies of Maleficent regularly alight upon Neverland's shores to steal its fabulous treasures. But the locals are wily & stubborn, & defend their isle like crows against hawks.</p>
<p><a href="pleasureisland.html" class="wikilink">Pleasure Island</a>: The Blue Fairy's reach is long, but the starscape is vast, & she cannot save everyone. She focuses on those lost children who pass a test of virtue (a banquet-table abandoned, forested with treats...), spiriting them to Neverland. Those who feast, well, the Coachman finds them before she returns.</p>
<p><a href="wonderland.html" class="wikilink">Wonderland</a>: Beyond the waking world, beyond the stars & planets, the rules that we call Story bend & discontinue. The abyss of un-space can access our planet at our moments of loosest ontology: day-dreams & night-dreams. And beyond Neverland, beyond Wonderland, there wells a benthic void of Nightmare, a don't-place of echoes that are not coachmen, of smiles that are not cats.</p>
