<p>In London, King John the lion sits the throne. Yet the true power in the realm lies in the forests to the north: The Horned King & Maleficent, now wed.</p>
<p>To the east lies <a href="arendelle.html" class="wikilink">Arendelle</a>. Ice statues gleam as London readies for the royal wedding. King Hans has offered the hand of Princess Anna to King John the Lion. Everyone is delighted by the arrangment, except the bride, who mutters behind her veil, "Love is a one-way door".</p>
<p>To the south lies <a href="paris.html" class="wikilink">Paris</a>. French troops have landed at Dover & fortified their camps. The French knights swing chains of cold iron, which is agony to fairies. English longbowmen take aim behind ranks of horned & winged defenders.</p>
<p>To the southeast lies <a href="germany.html" class="wikilink">Germany</a>. England & Germany are at peace in the same way that two rival anthills seem soundless from above, yet are tearing enemy limbs off below the leaves & soil. In MÃ¼nchen, traitorous dryads ambush solitary woodsmen. In Oxford, spies posing as theology students steal books of Merlin's secrets.</p>
<p><a href="neverneverland.html" class="wikilink">Never Never Land</a>: The fairies of Neverland were born in London, but fled its iron fences, iron mills, iron doorknobs. Fey armies of Maleficent regularly alight upon Neverland's shores to steal its fabulous treasures. But the locals are wily & stubborn, & defend their isle like crows against hawks.</p>
<p><a href="wonderland.html" class="wikilink">Wonderland</a>: Many beings have failed to map Wonderland. One cartographer, called Alice of Oxford, instead models that land as a probabilistic vector grid, with each square of the grid sending you up, down, left, or right with peculiar likelihoods. These peculiarities can be summed into overall chances of being ejected off the grid into various other lands. Alice landed in Northern Oz, where she now lives with her scarecrow husband.</p>
<p><a href="pridelands.html" class="wikilink">The Pride Lands</a>: English ships bearing gold & dried meat support the Pride regime, for King John is in fact a descendant of the Scar dynasty.</p>
<p><a href="virginia.html" class="wikilink">The United States</a>: King John is not happy to have lost thirteen colonies worth of tax revenue.</p>
