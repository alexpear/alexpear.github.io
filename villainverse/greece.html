      <label>Mount Olympos</label>
<p>Having unleashed the Titans once more against his brother Zeus, fire-headed Hades now rules heaven. The gods have been imprisoned on the other planets, save Ares, who serves Hades, & Artemis, who no foe can catch. The blasphemous Titans now stride knee-deep in the Mediterranean, & thousands of mortals have fled Greece to evade their fickle gaze.</p>
<p>To the north lies <a href="corona.html" class="wikilink">Corona</a>. One night per year, the Titan Tethys lowers her bone-cold palm to the gate of Corona, to collect three wagonloads of tithed gold. The following night, as they have for decades, the cofferless Coronans light flying lanterns & speak of hope.</p>
<p>To the southwest lies <a href="ursula.html" class="wikilink">the Mermaid Kingdom</a>. Even water dies as it pours down the River Styx. Draining from the ocean to Tartarus, it bears the Mermaid Kingdom's toughest strike force of sharks & lobsters, who tear into the defending shades of Persephone, ruler of the underworld in Hades' absence. Ferryman Chiron flees before Ursula's new allies: beastbodied Scylla & austere Thetis, mother of Achilles.</p>
<p>To the southeast lies <a href="agrabah.html" class="wikilink">Agrabah</a>. The Agrabah Sultinate is the only power in the Mediterranean that can match the might of Mount Olympos. Serpents of fire patrol Jerusalem's walls, as the jealous Cyclops wades out of the sea to make war.</p>
<p><a href="space.html" class="wikilink">Outer Space</a>: We rent our bodies from Hades, we do not own. Yet the Stovetop Tyrant asks the Federation for an advance, a tithe of early death. Asphyxiation imps & starlight Titans besiege once-healthy planets. But thousands of creatures fire back in defense - one Galactic Armada uniform worn by bodies of a thousand shapes & sizes</p>
