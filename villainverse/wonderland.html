<p>In your house or mine, the pet is the guest of humanity. But in different worlds it is otherwise. The Red Queen is in truth a kitten, but to call her that is to violate her fiercest edict, since a cat on the throne would make no sense.</p>
<p><a href="britain.html" class="wikilink">Britain</a>: Many beings have failed to map Wonderland. One cartographer, called Alice of Oxford, instead models that land as a probabilistic vector grid, with each square of the grid sending you up, down, left, or right with peculiar likelihoods. These peculiarities can be summed into overall chances of being ejected off the grid into various other lands. Alice landed in Northern Oz, where she now lives with her scarecrow husband.</p>
<p><a href="neverneverland.html" class="wikilink">Never Never Land</a>: Beyond the waking world, beyond the stars & planets, the rules that we call Story bend & discontinue. The abyss of un-space can access our planet at our moments of loosest ontology: day-dreams & night-dreams. And beyond Neverland, beyond Wonderland, there wells a benthic void of Nightmare, a don't-place of echoes that are not coachmen, of smiles that are not cats.</p>
