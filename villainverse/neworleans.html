      <label>New Orleans</label>
<p>French colonists have driven out the locals & built a city they call New Orleans. As if that weren't bad enough, French power in the city has since been usurped by the influence of the demons of Hell. Enterprising Satanists have signed away their afterlives for the opportunity to dominate public life. Now demon summoning is openly practiced in the militia barracks & the office of the Governor-General.</p>
<p>To the northwest lies <a href="bambi.html" class="wikilink">the Deer Forest</a>. The newest hunter in the wild forests is Gaston, a bold Frenchman who is eager to tame a New World in the name of colonialism.</p>
<p>To the north lies <a href="virginia.html" class="wikilink">the United States</a>. The hotels of Georgia are packed with preachers, called to defend their nation against Lousiana demons.</p>
<p>To the south lies <a href="colombia.html" class="wikilink">Encanto</a>. French ships periodically sail to conquer Encanto, but the winds of Pepa Madrigal's heart have so far prevented them from reaching shore. But the faces in Bruno's vision worry him, faces that are only pretending to be voodoo spirits.</p>
<p><a href="paris.html" class="wikilink">Paris</a>: Paris has put tariffs upon Louisiana to punish her for her traffic with the underworld. Plainclothes Jesuits, it is said, frequent the saloons of New Orleans, tricking fools into revealing the true names of devils.</p>
