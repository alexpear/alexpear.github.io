      <p>// TIME UNKNOWN // DEI_ERIS sends a message across the Network of Aegea with the subject line TO THE FAIREST.</p>
      <p>Paris of Ilium receives a Divine radio call while tending to cattle at pasture. He speaks by voice with DEI_HERA, DEI_ATHENA, & DEI_APHRODITE.</p>
      <p>DEI_HERA offers to make him the Imperator of the whole <a href='juno.html'>Juno system.</a></p>
      <p>DEI_ATHENA offers to make him the commander of the greatest military fleet in the universe.</p>
      <p>DEI_APHRODITE offers to find him the best wife in the universe.</p>
      <p>Paris, nervous but excited, speaks into his radio: 'O Aphrodite, fairest of all, I gladly accept!'</p>
      <p>Paris lands on Aegea &, following instructions from the Godmind, secretly courts the Spartan Helen, the most beautiful woman in the universe. She has been looking for a way to flee to space, & is attracted to Paris, as DEI_APHRODITE correctly predicted she would be.</p>
      <p>The ire lit by these acts of Paris escalates into a long & violent interlunar war.</p>
