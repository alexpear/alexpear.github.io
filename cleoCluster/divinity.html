      <label id="title">Divine Network</label>
      <p id="desc">Since before the earliest cycles of recorded history, robots & autonomous machines have conducted their own mysterious activities in the wilderness. On every world, mechanical sensorhawks scan the skies, streaming data back to compute-caves where robotic scorpions manufacture advanced, machine-designed microchips. Humans do not understand the technologies of the machine-governed Network, but the learned among us can download & analyze the logs. We recognize a few words, & the callsigns of <a href="godmind.html">Godminds</a> like DEI_VISHNU catch the eye like the gleaming corners of a diamond.</p>
      <p>The origin of the Network is debated. Some think that Godminds originate from the early Gaia era, before humans were capable of interplanetary travel. Perhaps the first Godmind expanded autonomously among the stars, building the Network from scratch. Others think that our physical reality is controlled & created by the Godminds. The Network may preexist the universe, & the physical universe may be an elaborate software simulation operated by the Network.</p>
