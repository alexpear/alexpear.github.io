Cleo Cluster

This is a wiki about a science fiction story. It is closely parallel to real life history & mythology, but it is about spacefaring civilizations with robotic armor & laser weapons.

To convert dates:
Take the CE year, truncate away the last 2 digits, & add 50.
320 CE -> 3 -> Cyc 53

Reverse:
Take the Cyc, subtract 50, & suffix 00 to it. This gives you the start of the Cyc (century).
Cyc 63 -> 13 -> 1300 CE

If that's hard, focus on Cyc 50. That's 1 CE thru 99 CE, aka the 1st Century. Count up or down from that. Cyc 60 is the century starting with 1000 CE.

Antecyc cycles count down to Cyc 0, much like how BCE years count down until CE years start counting up.
Cyc 0 = 5000 BCE thru 4901 BCE
