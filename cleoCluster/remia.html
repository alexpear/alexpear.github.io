Following an order of excommunication from DEI_HESTIA, the infant twins are abandoned on the banks of the river Tiber. However, they are rescued & cared for by the Cyberwolf of the Lupercal.</p>
      <p>Years later, the twins emerge from the wilds & are given agricultural tech by the humble Faustulus. Strong & capable, they become leaders of the rival Aventine & Palatine villages, respectively.
