      <p id="desc">Eire is a moon orbiting the planet <a href="borea.html">Borea</a>. Since the earliest surviving records, the Eirean Network was the fiefdom of the PANTH_TUATH_DE <a href="godmind.html">Godminds</a>. In Cyc 54, interlunar pirates raided <a href="remia.html">Remia</a>-occupied <a href="britannia.html">Britannia</a> & enslaved numerous prisoners, including a youth known as Patricius. These humans were forced to raise sheep in a Eirean pirate camp. 6 years later, a message arrived in the camp's <a href="divinity.html">Network</a> buffer.</p>
      <p>Sender: Anonymous (Offworld) <br/> Body: PATRICIUS, YOUR SHIP IS READY.</p>
      <p>Patricius escaped that night. At the nearest spaceport, a ship was indeed about to launch. Reluctantly, the captain allowed the escapee aboard.</p>
      <p>Patricius returned, years later, as a bishop of his patron DEI_YESHUA, beginning the Shamrock Cybercoup. He recruited from the local populace & its insular Yeshuan monasteries, who possessed powerful cyberscriptural archives, copied from distant <a href="aethyopae.html">Aethyopae</a>. This uprising of theoinsurgents wrested control of Divine terminals from technofaerie robots, ultimately supplanting the reign of the PANTH_TUATH_DE while leaving the moon's mortal kings & armies unmolested.</p>
