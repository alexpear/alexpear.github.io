  <p class="center">California Version</p>

  <div id="textarea">

    <p>The winner/s are whoever has the longest round as hiders.</p>

    <p class="bulleted">Custom Rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Players may only move in these ways:
        <ol>
          <li>On Foot
            <ul>
              <li>(escalators & elevators are fine)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>City Bus</li>
          <li>Trolley</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The final hiding spot cannot:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Be off-limits to the public</li>
        <li>Be somewhere that will close during the game</li>
        <li>Be a bathroom</li>
        <li>Be a store</li>
        <li>Be a restaurant</li>
        <li>Cost money to enter</li>
        <li>Block players internet connectivity (eg basements)</li>
        <li>Require climbing</li>
        <li>Be dangerous</li>
        <li>Inconvenience, disconcert, or creep out strangers</li>
        <li>Be right next to a private car or residence (no looking like a thief)</li>
        <li>Be in Mexico</li>
      </ul>
      <li>This is a SMALL game, not Medium or Large.</li>
      <li>Instead of 1 hider, a team of hiders may hide together.
        <ul>
          <li>If ANY hider is found, the round ends.</li>
          <li>The hider team shares the hider role - shared hiding spot, shared hand of 6 cards, etc.</li>
          <li>When the seekers enter the hiding zone, the hiders must be within 10 feet of each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Seekers must stay within 1/8 mile of their teammates at all times.</li>
      <li>After 2 hours, any player may unilaterally end the round if they want (for strategy or for fatigue).
        <ul>
          <li>(2 hours counted from the end of the 30 minute hiding period.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The penalty for accidentally breaking any rule is +/- 5 minutes to this round's final hiding time.</li>
      <li>If you didnt break any rules but nevertheless have to change hiding spots for some unexpected reason (eg squirrels start attacking you), you may move to a calmer hiding spot nearby, & discuss it with the seekers after the round.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="bulleted">Reminders:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The default hand size is 6. If your hand becomes overfull, you must immediately play or discard cards before continuing.</li>
      <li>At any time, anyone can ask to pause the game if necessary for health or comfort reasons.</li>
      <li>1/4 mile = 1320 feet ~= 2 North Park long blocks</li>
      <li>If you're still on a vehicle when your 30 minute hiding period ends, and you choose a transit stop within 1/4 mile of you as your station, you haven't broken any rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="bulleted">In each round:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The seekers must stay put for 30 minutes while the hiders travel to their hiding spot.</li>
      <li>After 30 minutes, the hiders must secretly choose a nearby transit stop (ie, a bus or trolley stop). This becomes their station for the rest of the round.</li>
      <li>Hiders may not be further than 1/4 mile radius from their station for the rest of the round. (They may move freely within this circle, however).</li>
      <li>When the seekers are also inside this radius, the hiders cannot walk & must stay wherever they are. (They don't have to notify the seekers, however).</li>
      <li>The round ends when a seeker gets within 5 feet of a hider.</li>
      <li>Then there's a 10 minute breather interval. Set up cards, dice, notebooks, & GPS sharing.</li>
      <li>A next round would start from this location.</li>
    </ol>
