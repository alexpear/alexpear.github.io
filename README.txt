This is the README file for the git repo for the personal website alexpear.github.io

This website include the following prototype projects:

* Tree Navigator - A random generator for text-based fiction and a simple UI for examining the output. Currently set up to generate detailed fleets of scifi starships, but the design is very flexible. WIP.

* Death Planet Fish Tank - A simulated world containing a endless battle. A top-down view onto this world. WIP.


To Do:
* See TODOs in timeline.js
* Add logic so that, on ActionReady events, creatures initiate their (only) Action.
* Add logic about every creature moving closer to its destination each tick.
