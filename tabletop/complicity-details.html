  <h1 class="center">Complicity - Rules FAQ</h1>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>When an action has <u>multiple effects</u>, can I do just one of them?</p>

    <p>No. If part of the action's effects will be impossible in the current game-state, you cannot choose that action at this time. For example, you cannot use the Man card if there is no pair of characters who share a Role & have €.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>But what if all effects of the action are possible when you start the action, yet some <u>effects become impossible halfway through</u> the action?</p>

    <p>If you find yourself asked to perform an effect which is impossible, the action then ends immediately. Discard any cards you drew or picked up, as normal. For example, say you start the <u>Demagogue</u> action & there is indeed a valid target who has no €. You hand Alice a card as normal, but then suddenly Bob talks you into a mischievous deal which involves paying €1 to all broke characters. Having thus made the 2nd part of the action impossible, the action ends.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>Can I make a deal with the current player that has no effect other than to <u>move my money around</u>, despite it not being my turn?</p>

    <p>Yes, if the current player agrees to it. The deal can consist of paying €1 from your Celebrity to their Partisan, followed by them paying the same €1 from their Partisan to your Heir, amounting basically to you moving €1 among your characters while it's not your turn. This is fine because the current player is involved. Of course, the current player is also allowed to refuse the deal, or insist on a fee as part of the deal...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>Can players make a <u>deal that doesn't involve €?</u> A deal where I promise to make a certain choice, & they promise to make another choice on the same turn?</p>

    <p>Yes, this is fine & the deal will be binding for the duration of the turn. Thus, if you suspect a tricky player will change their mind later in your turn & refuse consent during your Senator action, you can ask them for a deal up front: 'If I use Senator on the Criminal, will you consent to that?'</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>When a <u>Utopian with € goes to Mars</u>, can they leave their € behind on Earth?</p>

    <p>Yes. You can make payments at any time during your turn, so they can simply pay that € to another Utopian on Earth, then go to Mars. By contrast, if you only had 1 character & they were discarded or otherwise made inaccessible, you would have to either give up on that character's €, or pay it to a character you don't control.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>Does <u>peeking trigger a reshuffle</u> of the deck, the way drawing cards does?</p>

    <p>No. Only reshuffle when the deck is empty & you need to draw, discard, or move the top card of the deck. Thus, Of Many Plans can cause a reshuffle, while Investigator cannot.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>What if a <u>player leaves the game early</u>?</p>

    <p>Their characters become neutral characters. Continue without them as normal. At the end of the game, don't include their score when recording the Lowest Score for Posterity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>What if there's a fire drill & we all have to <u>end the game early</u>?</p>

    <p>Don't add anything to the History card for this game. It would distort the Lowest Score, & fire safety is more important anyway.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>Is achieving <u>Posterity possible on my first game</u>?</p>

    <p>No. On your first game, the History card will (presumably) be blank. At the end of the game, fill out 1 row of the History card. On the 2nd game, if the players have a better lowest score than the 1st game, they will each get the character-remembering reward. Even if different players are present from the previous game, the most recent row on the History card defines the Posterity objective.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <p>After scoring & achieving Posterity, can a Utopian player choose <u>a character on Mars for Posterity?</u></p>

    <p>Yes, in fact any player can do so. Posterity choices don't <i>access</i> (ie modify) characters.</p>
  </div>
