  <h1 class="center">Complicity - Rules FAQ</h1>

  <div id="main">

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> When an action has <u>multiple effects</u>, can I do just one of them?</p>

      <p>No. You may not decline to perform any effects.</p>

      <p>If the 1st step of an action is currently impossible, you may not use that action at this time. For example, you cannot use the Man card if there is no pair of characters who share a Role, or if all such characters are broke.</p>

      <p>If the 1st step is possible but a later step will be impossible, you may start the action.</p>

      <p>Whenever anyone is asked to perform an impossible effect, end the current action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> What if it is possible to perform <u>part but not all of an effect?</u></p>

      <p>If the effect consists of doing several things at once but it is only possible to do some of them, do as many of them as possible & then end the action. For example, you may use O.S. even when there is not enough Location € to reward all players. You will choose which players are rewarded, then the action will end when the Location € runs out. Similarly, if there is only €1 available on Transit System when you use Witch, you will get only €1 of the reward, & the action will end before the other player gets any reward.</p>

      <p>Note that discarding a deck's top cards will almost always be possible. If there are 2 cards left in the Hive deck & you use Transit System, you will reshuffle (see AT ANY TIME in the rulebook): Discard those 2 cards, turn the discard pile facedown, shuffle it, & discard 1 more card. You'll be left with only 1 card to choose.</p>

      <p>In the rare case that the Hive deck & Hive discard only contain 1 or 2 cards between them, Transit System will perform 3 discards then let you create a character from the resulting pile. If the Hive deck & discard are both empty, the action will have no effect.</p>

      <p>By contrast, actions that gather several cards & then operate on them, such as Socialite or Of Many Plans, may have effects that are only partly possible when there are very few Hive cards left between the deck & discard. This can end the action early.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> But what if all effects of the action are possible when you start the action, yet some <u>effects become impossible halfway through</u> the action?</p>

      <p>If you find yourself asked to perform an effect which is impossible, the action ends. Discard any cards you drew or picked up, as normal. For example, say you start the <u>Demagogue</u> action & there is indeed a valid target who has no €. You hand Alice a card as normal, but then suddenly Bob talks you into a mischievous deal which involves paying €1 to all broke characters. Having thus made the 2nd part of the action impossible, the action ends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> What if the <u>order of a card's effects</u> is important?</p>

      <p>If a rule says to perform multiple effects, do them in the order they are listed.</p>

      <p>If it doesn't specify the order, the current player may choose the order. For example, the order that players are rewarded at the end of Conspirator or O.S., or the order the 2 extra characters are discarded at the end of Socialite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> What if I'm asked to discard until I find a <u>card that isn't in the deck</u>?</p>

      <p>If you use <u>Celebrity</u> when all 5 characters of the Celebrity's Hive are already on the table, then we know finding a 6th card in the deck will be impossible. Consider this an impossible effect. Thus, it would cause the action to end early.</p>

      <p>BTW - If you are asked to 'Discard from the Hive deck until a card of this Celebrity's Hive is in the discard pile' & there is already a card of that Hive in the discard, then you should do nothing (ie, discard zero cards) & proceed. (If you started discarding anyway, I forgive you. Try to settle things to something approximately similar to the pre-discard situation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Can I make a deal with the current player that has no effect other than to <u>move my money around</u>, despite it not being my turn?</p>

      <p>Yes, if the current player agrees to it. The deal can consist of paying €1 from your Celebrity to their Partisan, followed by them paying the same €1 from their Partisan to your Heir, amounting basically to you moving €1 among your characters while it's not your turn. This is fine because the current player is involved. Of course, the current player is also allowed to refuse the deal, or insist on a fee as part of the deal...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Can players make a <u>deal that doesn't involve €?</u> A deal where I promise to make a certain choice, & they promise to make another choice on the same turn?</p>

      <p>Yes, this is fine & the deal will be binding for the duration of the turn. Thus, if you suspect a tricky player will change their mind later in your turn & refuse consent during your Senator action, you can ask them for a deal up front: 'If I use Senator on the Criminal, will you consent to that?'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> When a <u>Utopian with € goes to Mars</u>, can they leave their € behind on Earth?</p>

      <p>Yes. You can make payments at any time during your turn, so they can simply pay that € to another Utopian on Earth, then go to Mars. By contrast, if you only had 1 character & they were discarded or otherwise made inaccessible, you would have to either give up on that character's €, or pay it to a character you don't control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Can introducing a <u>Rhetorician or Partisan</u> card trigger its own effect?</p>

      <p>No. Say you use Transit System to take a Cousin card from the discard pile, & then randomly draw Rhetorician & make a Cousin Rhetorician. The removal from the discard pile occurs before the character is created. The card effect is only active when the card is part of a character.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> When I get to <u>peek</u> at a facedown card (eg, with Investigator), can I show the card I see to other players?</p>

      <p>No. You may tell them what you see, or you may lie about it. Trust is a valuable resource!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Does <u>peeking into an empty deck</u> trigger a reshuffle, the way drawing cards does?</p>

      <p>No. Only reshuffle when the deck is empty & you need to draw, discard, or move the top card of the deck. Thus, Of Many Plans can cause a reshuffle, while Investigator cannot.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> When exactly does <u>Rhetorician</u> happen?</p>

      <p>It happens when a card of that Hive leaves the discard pile, whether to a character or to the set of cards being operated on during an action. When a new character is created (eg, by Transit System), each existing Rhetorician of the new character's Hive will reward the current player. This also happens any time you 'swap', 'take' or 'pick up' a card from the Hive discard. Thus, 1 Sensayer action could activate 2 different Rhetoricians, if it involves picking up a card of each Rhetorician's Hive.</p>

      <p>It does not activate during setup or the setup draft, nor when an empty deck causes an automatic reshuffle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> During a <u>Socialite</u> action, is the text of the 3 new cards in effect?</p>

      <p>Yes. In fact, any Valets or Last Free Predators among those 3 may be activated by other players. Depending on the order the current player discards 2 of the 3 characters, a Valet can be accessed & used to end the action, potentially leading to more than 1 of the 3 characters surviving the action!</p>

      <p>By contrast, note that these Roles have little relevance during the Socialite action: Oathsworn, Partisan, Rhetorician.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Isn't so much focus on <u>Euros narratively weird</u>, since money is only mentioned rarely in the books?</p>

      <p>When a character has a lot of € cubes, this can narratively represent wealth, like the Utopians hoarding patents to fund their Mars project, or it can represent social influence, like how few groups would dare defy JEDD Mason, or physical security, like how Dominic Seneschal is a master of infiltration who is ready for anything. But we write '€' instead of 'Euro/Influence/Security tokens' or 'Resource cubes' because otherwise the font would have to be smaller!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> What if a <u>player leaves the game early</u>?</p>

      <p>Their characters become neutral characters. Continue without them as normal. At the end of the game, don't include their score when recording the Lowest Score for Posterity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> What if there's a fire drill & we all have to <u>end the game early</u>?</p>

      <p>Don't add anything to the History card for this game. It would distort the Lowest Score, & fire safety is more important anyway.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> Is achieving <u>Posterity possible on my first game</u>?</p>

      <p>No. On your first game, the History card will (presumably) be blank. At the end of the game, fill out 1 row of the History card. On the 2nd game, if the players have a better lowest score than the 1st game, they will each get the character-remembering reward. Even if different players are present from the previous game, the most recent row on the History card defines the Posterity objective.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> After scoring & achieving Posterity, can a Utopian player choose <u>a character on Mars for Posterity?</u></p>

      <p>Yes, in fact any player can do so. Posterity choices don't <i>access</i> (ie modify) characters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> If the rest of the table agrees to <u>focus on cooperating</u> for Posterity but I instead use Monopolist because I want to win, does that make me an <u>unsporting jerk</u>?</p>

      <p>In my opinion, no. I think it's fine for each player to pursue whatever goal they find most rewarding within the game, whether that be Posterity, the title of Winner, or any scenario they find interesting or satisfying. Complicity is designed to explore the tension between leaders who are incentivized both to cooperate & to fight.</p>

      <p>Of course, as in any social interaction, it's best to keep an eye on what each other player considers the bounds of appropriate behavior. It is courteous to tell them in advance, if it seems possible your playstyle will stray outside that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="linegroup">
      <p>=> When playing <u>online</u> via Tabletop Simulator, how do I peek at the top card of a deck with Investigator?</p>

      <p>Drag the top card off the deck & set it down on the table facedown. Hold Option+Shift (Alt+Shift on some keyboards) & hover the mouse over that card. This will let you peek at it. Put it back on top of the deck when you're done.</p>
    </div>
