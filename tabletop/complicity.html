  <p>Complicity is a high-variety card game that is free for anyone to play. You can try it out by printing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PCktDgbrN8h3OtQ1MoG4PUFsMjVgwzglgQgDCmJ7v4/">this document</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.adapalmer.com/publication/too-like-the-lightning/">Too Like the Lightning</a> is a wonderful science fiction novel by Ada Palmer about Louis XIV, modernity, improvement of the human condition, & murder.</p>

  <p>Complicity is a fan-made game inspired by this world of passionate ideologues, senators, spies, & metaphysical anomalies. I (Alex Pear) designed & developed this game over several years to view this story via a new, interactive perspective, & to experiment with games where you see new characters every time you play. Playtesters say the game is easy to learn, has quick turns, & encourages very satisfying asymmetric compromises between players. Have fun safeguarding your values in the political wilderness of the United Free Alliance!</p>
